Assignments for Day 2
===============


.. note::

	Day 2 will focus on numeric data types for linear algebra (vectors and matrices), introduce
	plotting features available in python, and show you how to read and write data from files on your
	computer.

	:red:`If you are already experienced using` :green:`numpy`, :green:`matplotlib` and doing :green:`file I/O`,
	we still ask you to actively participate and help others learn quicker by facilitating small
	group discussions in which you can share your insight.
